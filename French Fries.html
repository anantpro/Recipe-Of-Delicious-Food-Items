    French fries are pieces of potato that have been deep-fried. 
    These are deep-fried, very thin, salted slices of potato that are usually
     served at room temperature.
     French fries have numerous variants, from thick-cut to shoestring, crinkle,
      curly and many other names. They are usually eaten with tomato ketchup.

     <b>French Fries making process</b>   
    </h2>

    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>
        First cut the potato (peeled or unpeeled) into even strips, that should
         be then wiped off or soaked in cold water to remove the surface starch,
         and thoroughly dried. They may then be fried in one or two stages.
         Potatoes fresh out of the ground can have too high a water content resulting
          in soggy friesâ€”so preference is for those that have been stored for a while
    </p>
    
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>
    After cutting the potatoes, put them into a beaker filled with hot oil to let them 
    crisp the exterior. Also add salt to it. The amount of adding salt and the time to 
    fry the potato strips in the oil depends on the quantity of the potato strips.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>
    Then take out the hot potato strips(French fries), put them in a plate and serve them.
    You may keep a bowl of tomato ketchup or mayonaise to make the french fries tastier.
    And your French Fries are ready to eat.
